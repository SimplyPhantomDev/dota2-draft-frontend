## How It Works

This tool uses preprocessed hero synergy data to compute:
- **Best synergistic picks** from the remaining hero pool
- **Role-specific suggestions** depending on your filter
- **Win probability** based on full draft composition
- **Predicted enemy positions** using role conflict resolution
- **Transparent full breakdown** of hero pool performance

All calculations happen live in the browser using custom algorithms.
